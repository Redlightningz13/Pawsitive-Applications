# Rent Value Desktop App

This repository now includes a desktop calculator that helps you enter:
- average monthly rent per unit,
- weekly total property cost / price being charged,
- number of units,

and instantly computes:
- weekly cost per unit,
- cost as a percentage of monthly rent,
- a full sales paragraph with the calculated numbers substituted in.

## Run

```bash
python3 app.py
```

The app uses Python's built-in `tkinter`, so no third-party dependencies are required.
